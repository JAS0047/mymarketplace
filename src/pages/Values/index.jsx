                <p>Our Obsidian fabric inherits its deep black color from being woven from fine, dark threads. Right from the extraction of the fibers and their transportation for processing and drying, great care is taken to preserve the environment and foster an eco-centric attitude towards the vulnerable surrounding nature.</p>
